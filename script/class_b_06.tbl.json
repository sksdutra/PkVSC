  "class_b_06_math_03": "I know it was a little difficult with all that talk of\nmultiplication and percentages and the like.[VAR 0114(0025)]",
  "class_b_06_math_04": "But today, we’ll be talking about percentages\nagain to learn about probability.[VAR 0114(0025)]",
  "class_b_06_math_05": "That may sound like we’re going to have another\ndifficult class, but did you know that all of you\\r\nalready deal with probability on a regular basis?[VAR 0114(0025)]",
  "class_b_06_math_06": "Pokémon moves generally have a property called\naccuracy, which determines the probability that\\r\nthey will hit.[VAR 0114(0025)]",
  "class_b_06_math_07": "The accuracy of Tackle is 100—or 100 percent.\nSo if you were to use Tackle 100 times, you\\r\ncould expect it to hit all 100 times![VAR 0114(0025)]",

  "class_b_06_math_09": "That means you could expect it to hit 60 times\nin 100 uses. To put that another way—out of 100\\r\nuses, you could expect it to miss 40 times![VAR 0114(0025)]",
