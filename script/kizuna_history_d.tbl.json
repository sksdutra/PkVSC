  "kizuna_history_d_06a": "Judging by its shape and size, this vessel was\nalmost certainly NOT for everyday use.[VAR 0114(0027)]",
  "kizuna_history_d_07a": "Perhaps it was a work of art? Or, better yet, a\nritual artifact housing some sort of deity?![VAR 0114(0027)]",
  "kizuna_history_d_08a": "I feel that there must be some meaning behind\nthe horns and the designs resembling eyes.[VAR 0114(0027)]",
